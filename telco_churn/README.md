## Predict Customer churn
Churn is when a customer stops doing business or ends a relationship with a company. It’s a common problem across a variety of industries, from telecommunications to cable TV to SaaS, and a company that can predict churn can take proactive action to retain valuable customers and get ahead of the competition. 


### Concepts and types of Churn

    * Contractual churn, or when a customer is under contract for a service and decides to cancel their service. This can be found in Cable TV, and SaaS products.
    * Voluntary churn is when a user voluntarily cancels a service and includes Prepaid Cell Phones, Streaming Subsriptions.
    * Non-Contractual or when a customer is not under contract for a service is the next example of churn, and includes consumer loyalty at a retail location or online browsing.
    * Involuntary churn, or when a churn occurs not at the request of the customer and includes, credit card expiration.

Most likely, you as a customer have cancelled a service for a variety of reasons including lack of usage, poor service, or better price

# 1. Business Problem.
The data will be using comes from a Cellular Usage dataset that consists of records of actual Cell Phone customers, and features that include specific features to a customer’s cell service, like voice mail and international calling, cost for the service, a customer’s usage, and a feature of whether the customer cancelled their service or not.
## 1.0 Churn Definition
Here, churn is defined by the customer cancelling their cellular plan at a given point in time and is encoded in the dataset as no and yes.
